This project presents a hybrid movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 100k dataset. It combines Collaborative Filtering (SVD) with Content-Based filtering (TF-IDF on genres) to generate accurate top-K movie suggestions for each user. The system includes data preprocessing, model training, hybrid score blending, and a Flask API for delivering recommendations. Evaluation using RMSE shows good predictive accuracy. The project demonstrates practical application of AIML concepts, modular design, and real-world usability. Future improvements include richer metadata integration and advanced ranking metrics.
